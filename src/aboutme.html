             <h3>educational background</h3>
            <p>Born and raised in Dire Dawa,Ethiopia, I completed my <br>
              elementary and high school <br>
             education at Bisrate Gabriel <br>
             School. My dedication and <br>
             hard work paid off when <br>
             I successfully passed the <br>
             university entrance exam  <br>
             with commendable scores. <br>
             In 2022, I joined Addis Ababa <br>
             University, where I am currently 
             a third-year student pursuing a 
             degree in Software Engineering at the  <br>
             Addis Ababa Institute of Technology (AAIT). <br>
             My educational  journey reflects my  <br>
             commitment to  academic excellence <br>
              and my passion for technology.</p>

                <h3>personal philosophy</h3>
                <p>My personal philosophy, "know your worth," serves as a guiding principle in both my personal and professional life. It emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and self-respect, reminding me that I deserve to be treated with dignity and fairness. Understanding my value empowers me to make choices that align with my goals and aspirations, fostering resilience in the face of challenges. By recognizing my strengths and contributions, I cultivate confidence that propels me forward, encouraging others to appreciate their worth as well. Ultimately, knowing my worth inspires me to pursue meaningful relationships and opportunities that reflect my true potential.</p>
