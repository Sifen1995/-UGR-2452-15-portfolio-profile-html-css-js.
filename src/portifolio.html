            <img src="images/mysql.jpg" alt="">
            <p>In my recent project, I focused on flight scheduling and management by developing a robust database using MySQL. This involved designing a comprehensive schema to efficiently handle various aspects of flight operations, including scheduling, passenger information, and aircraft details. I implemented features that allow for real-time updates and queries, ensuring that all stakeholders have access to accurate and timely information. By optimizing the database for performance and scalability, I was able to streamline operations and enhance decision-making processes within the aviation sector. This experience not only honed my technical skills in database management but also deepened my understanding of the complexities involved in flight operations.</p>

            <img src="images/java.png" alt="">
            <p>In my recent project, I developed a recipe management application using Java that allows users to easily create, store, and manage their favorite recipes. The application features a user-friendly interface where users can input ingredients, cooking instructions, and categorize recipes for easy access. I implemented functionalities such as search and filter options to help users quickly find specific recipes based on dietary preferences or ingredients on hand. Additionally, I focused on data persistence by integrating a database to ensure that users can save their recipes securely. This project not only enhanced my Java programming skills but also deepened my understanding of software development principles and user experience design.</p>
